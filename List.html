    <p> A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. 
    The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong></strong>
            <strong>Unordered lists </strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a "ul" element.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an "ol" element.
        </li>
    </ol>
