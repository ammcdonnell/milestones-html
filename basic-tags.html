  <section>
<h2>Block-level text containers</h2>
<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available</p>
<p>A "p" tag, a "blockquote" tag, and a "pre" tag are all examples of block level HTML elements</p>
<p>A p-tag is used to define a simple paragraph of text</p>
<p>A "blockquote" element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Here is an example of the "blockquote" element in action: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes a computer special? That it is a machine that can simulate another machine. </p>
</blockquote>
<cite> ~ Jesse Farmer, Adjacent Academies</cite>
<p>For the blockquote tag, a URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, and the "cite" element (used above), can give a text representation of the source.</p>
<p>A p tag is used to specify preformatted text:</p>
<pre>The text in a "pre" element is displayed in a fixed-width font, usually in the Courier font.</pre>
<pre>The text in a "pre" element preserves    <en>spaces</en>  and
  <en>line breaks</en>. Thus,   the text is displayed exactly as it is
  written in the    HTML source code.
</pre>
<p>The pre tag is often used to display language examples because it displays the code as it is typed.</p>

  <h2>Inline Text Styling</h2>
  <p>Contrast to block-level text containers, inline text elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.</p>
  <p>The "em", "i", "strong", and "b" tags are all examples of inline text elements in HTML.</p>
  <p>The <em>"em" element</em> adds an <em>emphasis</em> to a particular inline text. This elements takes on an italic form in the broswer:</p>
  <p>The <i>"i" tag</i> is similar to the "em" tag as it defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood which is typically displayed in italic </p>
  <p>The <i>i tag</i> can be used to indicate technical terms, phrases in other languages, or a thought.</p>

  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <section>
  <p> A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements.
  The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
  </p>
  <p>
  <ol>
      <li> <strong></strong>
          <strong>Unordered lists </strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a "ul" element.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an "ol" element.
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an "li" (list item) element.</p>
  </p>
  </section>
<h2>Tables</h2>
<section>
  <p>A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (<strong>tabular data</strong>. </p>
</section>

  <p>Creating a Table</p>
  <ol>
      <li>
          First of all, make a locap copy of <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/tables/basic/blank-template.html">blank-template.html</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/tables/basic/minimal-table.css">minimal-table.css</a> in a new directory on your local machine.
      </li>
      <li>

          The content of every table is enclosed by these two tags : <img src="tables.jpeg" alt = "img" width ="200" height="20"> </p>
          element Add these inside the body of your HTML.
      </li>

      <li>
        The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a <img src="tables2.jpeg" alt="tables" width="100" height="20">

      </li>
